**First Script:**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Connects to server 35.172.230.83 with key in ~/.ssh/school

ssh -i ~/.ssh/school ubuntu@41.173.28.234
```

This script is meant to connect to a remote server at IP address `41.173.28.234` using SSH. It specifies the identity file (private key) located at `~/.ssh/school` for authentication and connects as the `ubuntu` user.

**Second Script:**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Creates RSA key pair

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f school -N "betty"
```

This script generates an RSA key pair using `ssh-keygen`. It creates a private key file named `school` and a corresponding public key file named `school.pub`. The `-N "betty"` option sets a passphrase for the private key (you should replace "betty" with your desired passphrase).

**Configuration Settings:**

The provided configuration settings seem to be related to SSH configuration and setup. Here's what they do:

1. `file_line` resource for turning off password authentication:
   - This block modifies the `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` file to disable password authentication by adding the line `PasswordAuthentication no`.

2. `file_line` resource for declaring the identity file:
   - This block modifies the `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` file to specify the identity file as `~/.ssh/school`.

3. SSH configuration settings:
   - Below the configuration resources, there seems to be an attempt to configure SSH settings for all hosts using a wildcard `Host *`. However, there is a typo: it should be `IdentityFile` instead of `IdentifyFile`. It should also be placed in the `~/.ssh/config` file (not `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`) if you want these settings to apply only to your user.
